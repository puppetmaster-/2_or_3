a game for kids to learn calculating while playing

This game was made for the [Godot Community Game Jam - Dec 2016/Jan 2017](http://itch.io/jam/godotjam122016).

My main goal was to create a little game to learn calculating but it should not feel like a "learning" game.


## Instructions

There are two numbers.
The green is your target and the orange is the starting one.

On the bottom there are two buttons (cube).
By pressing on them with
mouse or <-- and -->
you can change the orange number.

Try to reach the exact number.
